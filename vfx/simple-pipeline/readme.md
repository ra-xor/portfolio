## VFX pipelines:
### [Using Blender API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html)

The idea is to build a simple pipeline that:
- maybe open a 3d scene ( try to use OpenUSD )
- add an object ( cube )
- add / change camera
- add /  change lighting
- add plane
- create new material
- set the material color
- assign the material to the plane
- set render output properties
- set color managment
- render the scene - saved in "before" folder
- change lighting, plane material color or camera angle
- render the scene - saved in "after" folder

### [Using Houdini API](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/hou/index.html) 

do the same as above in Houdini API

### [Using Unity API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/)
do the same as above in Unity API ( C#)
(maybe more complex scene - like the hair ball )
